                    Changes in the economic structure since Corona 19 and their impact on our economy

                    The Bank of Korea said, 'The spread of COVID-19 is not only likely to cause a global recession, but also change the behavior of economic players.' Households are expected to increase their hedging tendencies as they face threats to their livelihoods and safety, and companies are expected to value not merely efficiency but also resilience and flexibility as they face unexpected production disruptions.<br><br>As well the bank says “These changes in the behavior of economic players will also lead to changes in the economic environment." It means increasing of non-face-to-face activities of households and companies increase, the transition to the digital economy is expected to accelerate, and the trend of de-globalization is expected to be strengthened due to strengthening protectionism and weakening human exchanges.<div class="post-content-img"><img src="src/img/jyw_pic.jpg"></div>Also, major economic changes caused by the COVID-19 crisis are expected to bring about changes in the economic structure at home and abroad. Although global trade growth will slow down due to the spread of the trend of de-globalization, it is expected that the acceleration of the digital economy will partially offset the negative impact of de-globalization through the expansion of ICT-based trade.<br><br>In addition, the bank says, "The smartization of the manufacturing industry will be promoted and the transition to non-face-to-face industries, ICT services, eco-friendly and bio-health-oriented industrial structures will be accelerated." In the labor market, employment in job groups with a high proportion of face-to-face work will decrease, while various types of jobs will be created around the non-face-to-face industry.<br><br>Such changes in the economic environment and structure after the COVID-19 crisis ultimately affect the growth and prices of our economy. In terms of economic growth, the downward pressure on the potential growth rate can be increased as the input of production factors is sluggish due to changes in the industrial and labor structure and slowing global trade. However, it says that increased productivity due to increased investment in the ICT industry will counteract this downward pressure.<br><br>From a price point of view, the trend of low inflation is likely to continue due to the increased inducement of reserve savings and downward pressure caused by the acceleration of the digital economy. However, it also says that the government should pay attention to the upward pressure caused by the accumulation of global liquidity and weakening global supply chain. It is worth noting that these structural changes can be seen in different directions and speeds for different countries rather than in a single one.<br><br>In response, the Bank of Korea said, 'Although there is a lot of uncertainty about the pace of structural change and the direction, it is unlikely that household, business and government behavior will return to the same state as before even if they escape the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.‘<br>
