                    Due to the YouTube craze, an Internet broadcaster was listed on the list of jobs for elementary school students. The far-reaching power and problems of YouTube's are significant.<br><br>
                    Illegal acts such as lewd behavior, sexual harassment, and violation of portrait rights can be punished. However, it is practically impossible to sanction content that is provocative but not illegal.<br><div class="post-content-img"><img src="src/img/lje_pic.jpg">기사와 무관한 사진</div>
                    There are calls for the government to regulate one-person media to create a clean YouTube culture. This is because YouTube filters out harmful videos, but the criteria are not clear.<br><br>
                    YouTube's regulation has yellow ticket. The Standards are inappropriate language, violent, adult content, controversial and sensitive case. When you get a yellow ticket, It is impossible to generate profits through video.<br><br>
                    The regulation even led to Kids videos. Kids tubes, in particular, have not yet established guidelines for YouTubers. It just emphasizes the importance of informing YouTube for children.<br><br>
                    Kids YouTubers are hard to produce their own content, so producers have to generate revenue for cost and time. An exaggerated performance may be forced for the completeness of the video.<br><br>
                    In the new form of child abuse, criticism of children's rights continues. Unlike in Korea, foreign countries are urging the establishment of legal devices for kids YouTubers.<br><br>
                    In the case of France, It has been pointed out that children are being overworked as YouTubers in children's rights organizations. The French government arranges with a regulation on them. On Oct. 7, it is looked ahead to president's approval by regulations requiring permission from the authorities when hiring a child YouTuber.<br>
