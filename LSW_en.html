                    The controversy over the sponsored advertisement of Youtuber that shook the broadcasting industry, And regulatory measures.
                </div>
                <div class="post-content">
                    sponsored advertisement means that influencer does not indicate that it is a paid advertisement after creating content to upload on YouTube or other sites in return for a certain company's payment. <br><br>The incident was triggered by YouTuber Cham PD and Hong Sound raising questions about YouTubers' sponsored advertising behavior, and the issue of Korean YouTubers' sponsored advertisement and advertisement marking has arisen. <br><br> In fact, the case has become a hot topic as many famous YouTubers repeatedly cheat as if they actually purchased it after receiving free support. <br><br> The scope of the sponsored advertisement is shown in the following example.
                    1) If the advertisement has not been identified through any channels;
                    2) If the live broadcast explicitly notifies that it is an advertisement, but not on
                    YouTube videos explicitly;
                    3) The Youtuber announced that it was an advertisement, not comments in the video or fixed comments, YouTube`s inclusive of paid advertising fuction, In case of marking in a place that is not easily visible, such as comments or more columns;
                    4) The case of distoring facts and exaggerating them into one-sides arguments. <br><br> 
                At this point, the main issue is not the legal issue for Internet celebrities, but the moral issue that has deceived viewers as if it were advertising but not advertising. <br><br> This issue is not just limited to YouTube and YouTubers, but it has become a mixed issue across the industry, including MCN, which is responsible for supervising them, and companies that commissioned and organized deceptive advertising for them, and it has caused a stir throughout the Korean broadcasting industry. <br><br> Due to this incident, the Fair Trade Commission revised the law. The law is as follows.
                Advertisements using YouTube, Instagram, etc. should be clearly marked so that viewers can recognize the existence of advertisements or sponsorships in accordance with the guidelines for review of recommendations and guarantees that will be revised from September 1, 2020.
                <br><br>
                Advertisements that deceive consumers have been banned early on, but there have been no institutional guidelines for proper advertising guidelines and regulations for Internet celebrities.
                As the revision has clarified the existing guidelines, which were somewhat ambiguous, the Fair Trade Commission has declared that it will consider criminal charges if the degree of violation is severe after a certain period of guidance.
                 <br><br>
                 In addition, the government also decided to impose fines of less than 2 percent or 500 million won on advertisers and YouTubers who advertise behind the scenes from January next year. <br>
